## Introduction
This repository will contain guides, exercises, assignments, and most materials that will be used throughout the course. However,
some sections in the course will require their own git repositories which will be linked down below.
This repository contains mostly fundamental guides and exercises, and boilerplates for you to jump start your projects' 
and exercises' development.

## Setup
### Tools (Download links)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [NodeJS (LTS Version)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Make Sure Tools Are Installed
Run these commands in the Terminal (MacOS & Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) without the $ symbol.

```
$ node --version
```
```
$ javac --version
```

## Rules of Thumb

### Lectures
Our lectures will normally start at **09:00**, so kindly be on time as every single course topic is important.
If you are sick or unable to attend the lecture for whatever reason, please inform the operational team and at least one
of your classmates. Github repositories will be updated daily, so don't worry about missing too much.

During lectures, feel free to ask questions whenever you need to, but please keep the questions related
to the **topic of the session** to avoid getting sidetracked. If you are too curious to not ask about a topic, 
you may personally ask me after lecture sessions.

I am sorry to say that eating in classrooms is prohibited to keep cleanliness. Small snacks are fine as long as
the trash and wrappers are thrown away where they belong. Drinking water in class is of course allowed, but do so
carefully, there will be a lot of electronic devices around you and you might wanna keep them dry.

### Assignments
At the end of every lecture, you will be given out assignments which are **required** to be submitted through email
(details will be given) **before 16:00**, those are your daily assignments. At the end of every week, you will be given more advanced assignments regarding the topics we have explored in that week, those are your weekend tasks. Please submit your weekend tasks every sunday **before 18:00**.

The solution of each assignment will be discussed in the beginning of every lecture.
Kindly do these assignments with your best individual efforts, as they will be used to track your learning
progress and improve your programming skills.

Submit your assignments to this **Email** address with the following **Subject**:
>Email: thedevmango@gmail.com

For Daily Assignments:
>Subject: **YOUR_NAME** CT_CIMB Assignment **MODULE** **DAY_IN_MODULE**

For Weekend Tasks:
>Subject: **YOUR_NAME** CT_CIMB Assignment **MODULE** Weekend Task **WEEKEND_TASK #**

Example:

Daily Assignment
>Subject: John Doe CT_CIMB Assignment Fundamental 4

Weekend Task
>Subject: Jane Doe CT_CIMB Assignment Fundamental Weekend Task 2

**NOTE**: Gmail might block you from sending **.js** files, send it as a **.txt** file instead.

### Exercises
I have provided several different exercises for you and they may be done independently. Note that some of the
exercises **will not** be discussed during **lectures**. However, feel free to ask and discuss said exercises with me
after class.
