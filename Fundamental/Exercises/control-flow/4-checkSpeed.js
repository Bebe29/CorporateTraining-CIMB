/*
Instructions:
Create a function that receives an integer (S) as an argument which is the
speed of a car. Log 'OK' when S is under the speedLimit. When
S is over the speedLimit, points (P) will be given based on how much
S exceeds the speedLimit divided by kmPerPoint. When P is greater 
or equal to 12, log "License suspended", if not, log how many
points the driver will receive.

Input: 130
Output: "License Suspended"

Input: 115
Output: "Points 9"

Input: 35
Output: "OK"
